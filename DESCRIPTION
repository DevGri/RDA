Package: RDA

  generated via the save() function.

Depends: bitops
Note:  We might also implement an alternative version of
  the RDA format that extends it by adding a table of contents
  at the end of the file. This allows us to add new entries
  and also to easily find the table of contents.
  If anyone is interested in doing this, please go ahead.
